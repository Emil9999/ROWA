Arduino Setup Representing the Physical Interface of the ROWA Farm
========

This documentation covers the circuit setup and the installation of the Arduino to represent the actual ROWA farm with 6
 LED stripes, one for each module and sensor measurements for the watertank (PH and Conductivity). Additionally it will
 be explained, how to control the Arduino over a serial connection via *Golang* functions.   

Look how easy it is to use:
